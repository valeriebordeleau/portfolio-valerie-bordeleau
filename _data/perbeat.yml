- title: Perbeat
  blurb1: The goal of this project was to create an android application to help people identify and manage their daily stressors. The main challenge of this project was that data from a wearable piece of technology was required. 
  blurb2: I began by speaking with peers who dealt with stress and identifying the pain points. From there I sketched out possible app flows and screens.
  blurb3: This app's main feature is a daily graph which shows users their current blood pressure, as well as their blood pressure overtime. This graph alerts users to new spikes in their blood pressure, which they can sort into custom categories.
  blurb4: Users can create custom category names, which are automatically colour coated to help them identify trends.
  blurb5: Users can get more information about how often each of their stressors affects them under the Patterns Tab. This allows users to identify and address their stressors.
