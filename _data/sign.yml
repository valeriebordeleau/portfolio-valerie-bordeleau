- title: Showtimes

  blurb1: The objective of this mock up and demo was to create a brief proof of concept for a digital sign which displays showtimes for special exhibitions at a nature museum. 
  
  blurb1.5:

  blurb2: I began by referencing how theatrical signage handles content. Then I sketched various concepts and created grayscale wireframes. I also considered what animations for content changes might look like.
  
  blurb3: From this point, I finalized the visual design. I utilized my own photography for this project, using it as a placeholder for featured content, such as exhibition artwork.
  
  blurb5: I then utilized After Effects to demonstrate various actions the sign would be required to perform.
