- title: Caffeinated Quest
  blurb1: This broadcast package was created for a fictitious television program in which coffee lovers discuss proper coffee crafting techniques. I began this project by creating mood boards, which helped me develop the look and feel of the package.
  blurb2: I then storyboarded the piece out and designed stills from a couple key scenes. Inspired by caf√© culture this piece features familiar paper textures from the walls of your local coffee house. This adds a new twist to the flat info graphic trend.
  blurb3: I then created a final product in After Effects and added royalty-free footage to demonstrate the look and feel of the final television program.
