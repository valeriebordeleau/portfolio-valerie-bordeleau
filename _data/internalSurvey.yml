- title: Internal Research Presentation

  blurb1: I was challenged by a co-worker to create a visually interesting method to better display research gathered via internal survey.

  blurb2: The solution had to be easily accessible, so that information could easily be found by various team members but was also suitable for corporate meetings. I began by creating various grayscale layouts incorportating research elements.
  
  blurb3: To meet these criteria, I created a visual design that could easily be translated from an easily accessible webpage design to a side deck suitable for regular meetings.
  
  blurb5: I then utilized After Effects to demonstrate the final product.
