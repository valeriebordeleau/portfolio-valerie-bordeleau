- title: Research Presentation

  blurb1: I was challenged by a co-worker to create a visually interesting method to better display research gathered via internal survey. The solution had to be easily accessible, so that information could easily be found by various team members but was also suitable for corporate meetings. 

  blurb2: To meet these criteria, I created a visual design that could easily be translated from an easily accessible webpage design to a side deck suitable for regular meetings. I began by creating various grayscale layouts incorportating research elements.
  
  blurb3: I then finalized the visual design. I envisioned the look and feel of this product to be simple, bold, and clean.
  
  blurb5: I then utilized After Effects to demonstrate the final product.
