  blurb1: The goal of this project was to showcase the work I have done this year in motion graphics. 
  blurb2: For the intro and outro of this project I wanted to incorporate footage to add an extra level of dimension to the shape-layer dominated piece. I employed a variety of techniques to create an aged look to this piece.
  blurb3: During the making of this project I created various shorter compositions to both act as filler content and to further develop my skills through experimentation.
